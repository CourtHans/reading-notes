### Images

Images have a unique set of CSS properties. Through CSS you can control size, alignment, position on the page, etc. You can also use images as backgrounds (taking in to account the contrast and how it will affect readability of your page). Image rollovers can positively affect your users' experience, as they can give visual clues to the interactivity. With a button, for example, you could store a sprite in your code that gives three different images - a passive, active, and hover position. You'd use the background position property in order to show the button in its right state. 

### Practical information

Search engine optimization is worth its own course of study, and can greatly affect the visibility of your site (and affect the outcome you're hoping to achieve). You can pull keywords not only into the text of your page, but into the meta-elements and links to help with browser algorithm performance. 

You can use tools like (free) Google Analytics to assess how your page is performing, who is visiting and from where, how long are they staying, what parts of your site are they interacting with. To put your site on teh web, you'll need to obtain a domain name and decide on your web hosting solution. 

### Flash

Not much to say about Flash! It was cutting cutting edge for a while, but there are better solutions available in 2020 (web technologies change quickly). But it's always good to know where we've been...

Pulling video on to your site seems to be a pretty complicated process. There are a lot of considerations to take in for how to optimize appearance and functionality of the controls. There are UX implications, different levels of browser support (and backup options to mitigate various levels of support). CSS rules to configure the appearance of the interactive controls (play, pause, rewind, fast forward) and JavaScript code to program the interactivity and responsiveness of the video to the user's needs.
