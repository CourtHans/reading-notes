[What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)

Google put some analytical research behind why some teams thrive, while others falter... a few key highlights:

> "Norms can be unspoken or openly acknowledged, but their influence is often profound."

"The right norms, in other words, could raise a group’s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright."

"As the researchers studied the groups, however, they noticed two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared. First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.’"  
"Second, the good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues."

***"Within psychology, researchers sometimes colloquially refer to traits like ‘‘conversational turn-taking’’ and ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ as aspects of what’s known as psychological safety..."***

Advice: "We must be able to talk about what is messy or sad, to have hard conversations with colleagues who are driving us crazy. We can’t be focused just on efficiency."

Successful teams don't usually just 'happen.' Each group member (and this goes doubly for a group leader/manager/authority figure) needs to do their part to establish norms that create psychological safety. This includes parameters - if you will - to ensure that team members' needs are being met, that they're being heard, that they aren't afraid to be their authentic selves. With norms that embrace authenticity, you can diffuse tension, avoid groupthink, and innovate further and faster than teams that don't enjoy such freedoms. In short, **psychological safety** is key to any group's success!
