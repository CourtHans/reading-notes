[The Past, Present, and Future of Local Storage for Web Applications](http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/storage.html) 

Web applications want/need storage. According to the author:  
"What we really want is:
* a lot of storage space
* on the client
* that persists beyond a page refresh
* and isnâ€™t transmitted to the server"

HTML5 storage is "a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser" and "unlike all previous attempts at providing persistent local storage, it is implemented natively in web browsers, so it is available even when third-party browser plugins are not."

HTML5 storage relies on key/value pairs.

***Reminder*** that *data is stored as strings* and you'll have to parse it out if you need a different datatype.
